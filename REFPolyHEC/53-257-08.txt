TitreCours: Financial Crises
DescriptionCours: Conventional models of financial markets are designed to explain the behavior of well-functioning markets. Occasionally, however, financial markets display extreme behavior that requires alternative models. This course enables students to understand the circumstances leading up to such episodes, the market forces behind such behaviors and their aftermath.  The course focuses on speculative bubbles, bank runs, and exchange rate crises. It reviews models for each type of behavior, discusses the extent to which such behavior can be reconciled with the usual assumption of investor rationality and notes policy and regulatory responses to such crises. Considerable emphasis is placed on the study of historical as well as recent episodes of financial crises.  &nbsp;  These will range from the 17th century to 2008, include countries such as the US, Argentina, Sweden, Japan, Albania and Holland, and markets for a variety of financial assets such as real estate, foreign exchange, stocks and bank deposits.
