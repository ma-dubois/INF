TitreCours: CO-ADMI 811Q The Theory and Practice of Organizational Leadership
DescriptionCours: This course adopts the interactional framework of leadership, which considers that the leadership process is a function of three components: the leader, the follower, and the context. The course is structured to cover classic and emergent theories that address each of these components; though most theories focus on one of these three components, they also inform the other components in the model as well, either implicitly or explicitly. Implications for the practice of leadership will be addressed through class discussions. An effort is also made in this course to ensure that students do not adopt a myopic view of leadership.&nbsp; Rather, different perspectives on the process of leadership are presented, that make radically different assumptions. Students will, therefore, be required to identify these assumptions and develop well articulated arguments that either support or go against these assumptions in order to develop a sophisticated view of leadership.  &nbsp;&nbsp; To Consult Seminars'Schedule, Click Here &nbsp;&nbsp;
