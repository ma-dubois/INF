TitreCours: Competition and Strategic Behaviour
DescriptionCours: The purpose of this course is to provide students with the ability to analyze competitive interactions. The focus is on a theory of strategy in which each competitor simultaneously chooses his/her strategy, taking into account the strategies of his/her opponents. Crucial to this theory is the anticipation of the behaviour of one's opponent and, in particular, the expectation that one's opponent is equally intelligent. Attention will be given both to the development of techniques for analyzing competitive interactions and to the application of these techniques. Game theory and the economic theory of industrial organization provide the basis for the theoretical constructs developed in the course. Topics that will be explored include: price competition and non-price competition (product positioning, advertising, quality differentiation), market entry and exit decisions (entry deterrence, predatory pricing, mergers and acquisitions), research and development as a competitive strategy,&nbsp;retailer and manufacturer competition, and auctions.
