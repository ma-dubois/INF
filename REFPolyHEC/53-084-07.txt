TitreCours: Management of International Investments
DescriptionCours: The objective of this course is to enable students to analyze major problems relating to the decision to make investments in an international context. The financial management of an international company differs from that of a purely domestic company in that it entails new variables, specifically, the foreign exchange risk and the political risk. Throughout this course, the methods we will present for assessing international investment projects will take these variables into account.  The criteria used to select an investment project call for the application of a company's cost of capital. For this reason, one of the course sessions will be devoted to the assessment of the cost of capital in an international context.  Another session will be devoted to the assessment of international stock market investments. The objective will be to study how the application of the portfolio theory (specifically, diversification and risk measurement) may contribute to a better risk assessment for multinationals.  This course is part of a group of three international finance courses offered to MBA students at HEC Montreal: (1) Foreign exchange risk management ( Gestion des risques de change ); (2) International financial markets ( Marches internationaux des capitaux ); (3) International investments management ( Gestion des investissements internationaux ).  &nbsp;  COURSE GRADING  The grading of the course is as follows:      Participation   10%    Case   40%    Final Exam   50%    Total   100%
