TitreCours: Managing Product and Service Variety
DescriptionCours: The central question is how firms can design and manage their products and services and associated production and supply chain processes so they can provide a large variety of products in a cost-efficient and/or time-efficient way.  This course is of interest for students who already know that from a marketing point of view a large variety is preferable, but now also want to understand the flip side of the coin, namely the operations and logistics aspects of this. What are the problems related to having a lot of variety and what are possible solutions? The focus of this course is on the production and logistics aspects, but obviously there are interesting links with marketing and innovation management as well.  In the first two sessions, we will introduce the topic of product variety and discuss the challenges associated with it. We first must understand how product variety has an impact on basic OM concepts such as inventory management, flexibility, risk pooling and forecasting. In the next sessions we will focus on solutions that help to deliver a large variety while still being cost and time effective. Topics discussed include postponement, component commonality, platforms, modularity, standardization, flexible machines, design for variety, mass customization, efficient versus flexible supply chains. We will also see how these concepts apply to services.
