TitreCours: Services Marketing
DescriptionCours: This course explores the difference between service and manufacturing operations, and the degree of distinct marketing skills and tools required: unique characteristics stands for unique marketing strategies. It is based on lectures, cases selected from a variety of service operations with a particular interest on service business models and their evolution or reinvention, and highly specific readings, all of them being closely connected. It has been designed to consider equally the macro issues as well as the nuts and bolts. Some of the topics that are addressed in this course, though not exclusive are: value-driven services with a strong customer orientation, service encounter and delivery, service profit chain, service package and blueprints, internal marketing, life time value, long term relationships, CRM, satisfaction and loyalty effect, complain management and service recovery, managing service quality, services on the Internet. Please remember that (1) people think of customer service as this cleanup act, this garbage collection at the end of the process. It is not that. It is a powerful competitive edge; (2) there is a significant correlation between the customer satisfaction index with the service of a company and it's financial performance; and (3) lessons from service industries do apply to manufacturers. In a nutshell, services mean job opportunities for the MBA students. There is both a strong and long term demand for expertise in the area: keep it in mind!
