DescriptionCours: This is an internship course during which students will spend 5 full weeks (or the part-time equivalent) in either a primary or a secondary classroom.

On-campus meetings will allow students to come together to analyze and reflect on their teaching experiences, on the effectiveness of different techniques and activities, and on observations made in different teaching contexts. The results of the reflective activities will be added to the students' portfolios.
