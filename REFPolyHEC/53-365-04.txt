TitreCours: Managers and Negotiation I
DescriptionCours: Rationale of the seminar We negotiate every day, often unconsciously, with people at all levels. These negotiations take place either one on one or in a group, and may be intra-organizational or even inter-organizational. In the financial, commercial or organizational sphere, negotiations rarely end at the signing of a contract. Most often, signing the contract is simply one step in the ongoing negotiation process. This is especially true when the agreement signed involves a long-term relationship. In this sense, the way in which negotiations unfold most likely sets the tone for subsequent negotiations. The success of negotiation is not measured only by the short-term results.  &nbsp;  Philosophy of the seminar As negotiation is part of the reality of managers and professionals, this training draws on the experiences of participants, who will be encouraged to share their "success stories" and the difficulties they've encountered and to analyze these in relation to the concepts taught in this course.
