TitreCours: Project Management
DescriptionCours: This course in project management is intended to develop an adequate understanding of the roles, activities and responsibilities associated with project management. We will pay particular attention to projects-activities (non-repetitive, risky, uncertain), as opposed to operations-activities (repetitive, predictable, standardized), with a view to demonstrating that project management requires different management skills, action logics and managerial representations. The course situates project management in the context of the development of businesses, the race to apply knowledge, and the constraints imposed by competitiveness. Students will be initiated into the use of project management tools in an approach that seeks an understanding of their relevance and their limitations. This course's pedagogical orientation involves management situations and project analysis via case studies and an intensive, one-day project management simulation that will enable students to experience some of the determining moments in typical project trajectories.
