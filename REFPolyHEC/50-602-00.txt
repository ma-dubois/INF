DescriptionCours: This course has been conceived for students who wish to refresh their notions of statistics. The main purpose of the course is to study the main techniques of data analysis and descriptive statistics as well as interpreting the results obtained. The concept of distribution and their graphical representations will also be discussed. We shall explain techniques to evaluate central tendancy and dispersion measurements. Finally, we shall study the dependence of two variables, two-dimensional representation, concepts of linear correlation and independence as well as the principal laws of distribution.
