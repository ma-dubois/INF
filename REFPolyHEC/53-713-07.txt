TitreCours: ERP Simulation Game
DescriptionCours: This course targets all executive decision makers specifically those from operation management, finance, marketing and information systems.  This course proposes a "learning-by-doing" approach to learn the concept about IT infrastructure, and more specifically ERP technologies. &nbsp; Using a simulation game, students are placed in a situation in which they have to run their business with a real-life ERP (mySAP ERP). In groups of 5 students, each team operates a made-to-stock manufacturing plant that interact with suppliers and customers by sending and receiving orders, delivering their products and completing the whole cash-to-cash cycle. Using standard reports, they have to make business decisions to ensure the profitability of their operations. This business simulation course is set to last 6 weeks and concludes a one day business simulation game that takes the place of the regular final exam.
