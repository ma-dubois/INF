TitreCours: Macroeconomic Environment
DescriptionCours: As the word macro suggests, macroeconomics is concerned with the performance of the overall economy. If in microeconomics little attention is paid to how individual decisions combine to form the larger picture, in macroeconomics, this larger picture is the subject matter. What explains economic growth? Why are some countries doing so much better than others? What are the causes of persistent inflation? How can a country adjust to a balance of payments deficit? These are typical examples of questions addressed by macroeconomics.  From a managerial point of view, these questions are less remote than what might be thought. First and foremost, predicting the economic environment in which managerial decisions are taken is crucial to the success of an organization. Decisions such as expanding capacity on the eve of a deep recession or issuing short-term debt when interest rates are about to rise sharply could have dire consequences. Second, the quality of management is a critical ingredient to a country's performance. Promoting a general improvement in the quality of management could in itself be seen as a well thought macroeconomic policy. Finally, managers should have their say in the establishment of the set of rules guiding macroeconomic policies. A thorough understanding of the issues at stake is essential if they are to make a meaningful contribution to the debate.  This course has one primary objective which is to develop among students an ability to predict their macroeconomic environment. At the same time, it is hoped that the course will give students a sense of their role as managers in the process of economic growth and help them participate constructively in the national macroeconomic policy debates. To this end and throughout the course, several examples will be drawn from both the canadian and the international experience.
