TitreCours: Business Plan
DescriptionCours: Learning how to prepare a business plan is a basic skill in the administrative sciences.&nbsp; It will be of use primarily to people considering the possibility of going into business, and to others as well.  &nbsp;  Preparing a business plan is an excellent way of understanding how the various parts of an organization fit and function together. In other words it makes you learn about, the links between its components and how they interrelate with the surrounding environment.  &nbsp;  It also requires a synthesis that forces entrepreneurs to focus their administrative and other knowledge around a project they themselves have defined.  &nbsp;  Graduates in administration will be asked to join boards of directors and apply their managerial expertise.&nbsp; The learning acquired when preparing a business plan will help them diagnose organizational situations quickly and accurately.  &nbsp;  It is difficult to design a course tailored to the needs of every member of a large group, and yet, it is precisely this that would be ideal when teaching the steps in preparing a business plan.&nbsp; The entrepreneurial craft, like other creative crafts, is the expression of a highly personal viewpoint.&nbsp; This course, presented in workshop form, attempts to reflect this dynamic by allowing students to trace their own paths, as far as possible, as they learn through a process based principally on discussion and exchange.  &nbsp;  The first part of the course examines the aspects of organization, management accounting and finance required to complete a business plan.&nbsp; The course also addresses the start-up phase, since research has shown that this is one of the weaknesses in current venture creation programs.&nbsp; Students are trained to produce excellent business plans, but are unprepared&nbsp;to launch the business.&nbsp;The course therefore aims to guide students through the process of preparing their plans and translating them into action, either by launching a new business or acquiring an existing one.  &nbsp;  Two courses are an excellent preparation for this course: "Visionary and Entrepreneurial Thinking" (53-456-03) and "Sectorial Analysis and Business Opportunities" (53-467-04). The course: "Small Business Management" (53-457-05) is complementary.
