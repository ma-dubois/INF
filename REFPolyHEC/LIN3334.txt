TitreCours: Teaching ESL
DescriptionCours: This course introduces students to working with a wide variety of different text types in ESL teaching. Students will learn how to select appropriate texts for different levels and ages of learners, how to evaluate texts according to the cognitive, syntactic, lexical and pragmatic difficulties they contain, how to modify a text for use with a specific group of learners, how to use a single text in several different ways, how to create their own texts, and how to use technological resources to find, assess or enhance texts. Emphasis will be placed on using a variety of English texts representative of contemporary work throughout the English-speaking world (Canada, the USA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean and the Indian sub-continent). The development of students' skills and professional abilities will be documented by means of a portfolio.
