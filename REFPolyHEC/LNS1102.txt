TitreCours: Internship 1
DescriptionCours: This internship course is designed to familiarize students with the school system and culture in which they will work as ESL teachers. Students will have the equivalent of 10 contact days at the primary or secondary level. During this time they will observe and engage in active teaching of small groups of learners. This internship is designed to lead participants to reflect on the act of teaching, professional ethics, and their own responsibilities as teaching students. Activities undertaken during this internship will help students integrate theory and practice, particularly as concerns the use of curricula, planning skills, teaching skills, and working with learners in need of enrichment or remediation. Students will analyse their experience and add information to their portfolios.
