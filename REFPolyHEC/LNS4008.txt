TitreCours: From ESL Student to ESL Professional
DescriptionCours: The aim of this course is to provide a summative overview of progress made by students in the course of their BA programme so that each individual can identify points to be strengthened and areas of professional interest to be explored in the years to come. This course comprises two main activities : 1) Problem solving which requires the student to pull together different types of knowledge (decision-making skills, collaborative work, communication skills); 2) An individual presentation during which each student will discuss how he or she has progressed professionally over the four years of the programme. A written report and the electronic portfolio will be included in support of the presentation. The student can also draw on information and ideas from the on-line community of student teachers of which he or she has been a member for 4 years. The presentation will be made before a committee consisting of two faculty members or instructors. Concomitant: LNS4108; LNS4208; LNS4308
