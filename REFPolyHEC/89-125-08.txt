TitreCours: QM-ADM 996I Seminaire sur les theories en marketing
DescriptionCours: The main objective of the seminar is to make students appreciate the relevance and importance of marketing history to the development of marketing theory. The approach taken in the seminar will help students understand what marketing is, where it came from as a discipline, and where it is going. After all, most of the students will eventually become marketing professors. It is vitally important students have a solid understanding of the history of marketing thought because today's research preoccupations and interests will not be the same in 10 or 20 years from now. The seminar helps doctoral students prepare for the future. The material presented in the seminar will help students prepare for a life long career as a marketing professor, irrespective of one's interest in a particular topic or area of specialization at the present time. There is a weekly assignment but students are only required to submit a total of seven, that is one per two weeks on the average.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Pour consulter l'horaire des cours, veuillez cliquer ici&nbsp; &nbsp;
