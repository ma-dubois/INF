TitreCours: Advanced Planning Systems for Supply Chain Management
DescriptionCours: Supply Chain Management concerns organizational aspects of integrating separated organizations as well as coordinating material and information flows within a production-distribution network. Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) systems being used for transaction handling and order execution in most firms today have been supplemented by Advanced Planning Systems (APS). Advanced Planning Systems (APS) are software systems that support the solution of planning problems in Supply Chain Management and Operations Management using quantitative solution methods. APS significantly extend the capabilities of the widely used Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.  This course is devoted to the study of Advanced Planning Systems, the concepts and functionalities underlying these, the current limitations of APS, how it links and interacts with ERP systems, what is required for successful implementation.  The course covers APS in general but is also taking advantage of participation of HEC Montreal within the SAP University Alliance to allow the students to get hands-on experience on mySAP SCM and in particular with the Advanced Planning and Optimization (APO) module which is a state-of-the-art example of APS.
