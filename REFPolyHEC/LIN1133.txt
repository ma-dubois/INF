TitreCours: Advanced English Grammar
DescriptionCours: This course is designed to allow students who have a high degree of procedural mastery of spoken and written English to start to acquire the declarative grammatical knowledge they will need as teachers of English as a second language. Students will learn grammatical terminology, and engage in sentence parsing and constituant analysis. They will also learn how to use corpora of written and spoken English and concordancers and parsers to improve their analytical skills and to deepen their understanding of the workings of the noun phrase and the verb phrase in English with a view to teaching English as a second language.
