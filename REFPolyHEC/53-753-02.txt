TitreCours: Information Technologies and Process Re-engineering
DescriptionCours: The introduction of new technologies in organisations requires to reconsider the organisational operating modes in order to determine how the new technologies can support the business processes to make them more effective and efficient, and how the processes can be transformed by new technologies. The experience shows that it's by the rigorous realisation of this process that the companies can obtain the lever effect and maximise their investments in information technologies (IT). Business process reengineering (BPR) and development of the information systems can't be separated. They must be carried out simultaneously to obtain the best adjustment between the systems and the processes. These adjustments between processes and systems require, of course, to re-examine the approaches and the methods used to introduce IT, but more especially to reconsider the role of these technologies as infrastructures which will support the processes and either the functions or the administrative structures. By modifying the role of IT, the companies will be then in a position to improve firstly their organisational effectiveness and possibly their operational efficiency.     The specific objectives of this course are:   To clarify the BPR concept;  To study existing theories on BPR;  To examine the role of IT in BPR projects;  To integrate BPR existing tools;  To identify success factors to BPR projects. attr attr
