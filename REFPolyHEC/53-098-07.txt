TitreCours: International Strategic Management
DescriptionCours: Today's executives are increasingly leading organizations into the new and often uncharted frontiers of international markets. International Strategic Management is about how firms become international&nbsp;and cope with the related strategic challenges. We focus on firms of all sizes, from many countries, as they come to grips with an increasingly competitive global environment. The fundamental objective of the course is to develop effective managerial and business leadership skills for dealing with the distinctive management problems that arise when firms do business across national borders.  &nbsp;  The focus of the course is on the internationalization process. In this section we develop an awareness of the impact of international forces on the firm's strategy and structure. It helps to demystify international business so a meaningful study of multinational management can occur. We also focus on the decision to go abroad and the selection of an organizational mode for entering foreign markets.  &nbsp;  This course complements other courses and disciplines related to strategic management, cross-cultural management and organizational behavior, and the global environment of business (trade, finance, law, etc.). In International Strategic Management our focus will be on the firm and the manager in an international context.  &nbsp;  EVALUATION Participation 25% Case-reports 30% Take-home exam 45%
