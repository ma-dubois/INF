DescriptionCours: This course examines the issues surrounding corporate governance from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The course is organized around four major themes. In the first part of the course we examine the corporate governance problem using an agency theory framework. Thus we examine the implications arising from the separation of ownership and control. In the second part of the course we examine the role played by different ownership groups in either promoting or constraining good corporate governance. Part 3 of the course examines executive compensation and board of directors composition and their usefulness as mechanisms to constrain agency problems. In the concluding section we examine some broader issues relating to corporate governance and investigate whether there is divergence or convergence of corporate governance regimes.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Pour consulter les horaires de cours, veuillez cliquer ici&nbsp; &nbsp;
