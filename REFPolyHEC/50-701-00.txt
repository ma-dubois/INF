TitreCours: Business Software
DescriptionCours: This course will cover the software tools that will help you analyse a problem in a structured manner (Excel) and communicate your results in a well-structured report (Word).&nbsp; It is not meant to be an Excel Course or a Word Course; it is rather a course covering the features of these programs that are useful in a business context. Since an important part of a manager's job is to communicate information and results, the Word portion of the course will cover those features that are geared towards producing a well structured report. Another important part of a manager's job is to analyse data and evaluate different scenarios in a decision-making situation. Thus, the Excel part of the course will cover the features that will let the manager develop a model of his situation, analyse different scenarios and produce the appropriate tables and graphs to support his decision.
