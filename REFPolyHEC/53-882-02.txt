TitreCours: Energy Sector : A Worldwide Perspective
DescriptionCours: The objective of this course is to provide a general overview of the energy situation in the world and to help the student understand today's main issues and challenges of the energy industry. Referring to the Industrial Organisation framework, we look at market characteristics such as the level of competition, horizontal and vertical integration, entry barriers, price determination mechanism and their evolution over the years. After a general overview of the energy trends in the world, we look at how specific energy markets operate, what kind of contractual arrangements found in the various segments of the industry. A special attention is given to the operation of a cartel and the role of OPEC. Participants will be asked to apply the concepts used in the course and write a short paper and make a presentation.
