TitreCours: Being a Consultant
DescriptionCours: Businesses have to adapt and often to undertake major changes to deal with challenges and seize opportunities that arise. In this context, all aspects of the organization must come under review. The role of the manager has become more complex, and consultation, whether it is internal or external, has gained in importance.  This course fosters the acquisition of knowledge, the development of skills and attitudes, as well as the understanding of certain tools necessary for being a consultant. Emphasis is placed on the consultation process; that is, the ways in which consultants help managers or client organizations. It does not focus on technical or professional expertise associated with a specific field of activity.  This course is thus intended for all students interested in either internal or external consultation, be it related or not to their areas of expertise. It is also intended for managers concerned about understanding and evaluating the contribution of consultants within their organization. The main themes addressed are:  &nbsp;    The emergence of problems or concerns in the client-system.   The building of a trustful client-consultant relation.   Consultation from the point of view of the manager.   The steps involved in consultation.   A few methods and instruments useful in intervention.   The consultant as a person: attitudes, beliefs and ethical rules.   The intervention team.   The consultation industry.
