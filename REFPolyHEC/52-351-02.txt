TitreCours: Strategic Human Resource Management
DescriptionCours: The underlying premise of this course is that human resources are an important source, if not the most important source, of a firm's competitive advantage in the global economy. Knowledge and skills, coupled with the ability of employees to innovate and adapt, constitute key assets for the organization in today's turbulent economic environment. As a consequence, managers are turning their attention to human resources (HR) issues. It is the purpose of this course to offer a framework for thinking about managing human resources strategically. To better meet the needs of managers, the course adopts a broad perspective, one that goes beyond the narrower, more operational concerns of the HR professional.  &nbsp;  The course attempts to provide participants with answers to the questions managers most often ask about human resources management (HRM). To better orient course participants and allow them to prepare for class discussion, key questions raised by managers have been identified and placed at the beginning of each session in the course plan.  &nbsp;  The course covers several themes. The first three sessions of the course focus on what it means to manage human resources strategically and explores how such an approach can contribute to botton-line organizational performance. The HR strategies of firms that have successfully managed people to achieve their overall business strategy are presented and analyzed. In the latter three sessions of the course, students are exposed to several key HRM issues (a) best practices in attracting, retaining and developing employees in a changing context; (b) how to manage with unions; and, (c) the people implications of organisational restructuring.&nbsp;
