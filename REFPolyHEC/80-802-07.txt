TitreCours: Empirical Methods in Monetary Economics and Finance
DescriptionCours: The primary objective of the course is to link modelling and empirical issues in modern macroeconomics. In the first part we study recent developments in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) modelling. Given their prominent role in current macro models, particular attention will be devoted to the role of frictions and rigidities. Next, we show how DSGE models can be estimated using state-of-the-art econometric methods. At the end of the course, students should have a clear understanding of the link between macroeconomic models and econometrics techniques.
