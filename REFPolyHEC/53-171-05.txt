TitreCours: Digital Marketing Strategy
DescriptionCours: The Increasing digitization of economic activities deeply impacts the overall configuration of business models and generates major mutations. Such mutations can be incremental only and apply to conventional business models. Or they can be disruptive and translate into the creation of new-to-the-world business models. Whatever the magnitude of change, many experts refer to Darwin and promote a controlled evolution instead of a bloody revolution. All of them are in search of value creation for both customers and firms. Marketing, innovation and execution are the key drivers of success. The stake is as high as the task is complex.
