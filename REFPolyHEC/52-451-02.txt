TitreCours: Strategic Management I
DescriptionCours: This course is at the center of the series of courses addressing strategic management issues in the MBA program. It complements and builds on the basic notion examined in the Simulation module and prepares the participants for the second module and those addressing strategic change and international strategy issues. It exposes participants to the main tool of contemporary strategic analysis.  &nbsp;  The focus of the course is those problems that are of general management relevance, that are critical for the short-term survival and long-term development of the firm. These strategic problems are most often vague, ill-defined, transfunctional or involve various individuals within the firm. They may question the culture of the firm, its role in its society as well as its existence.  &nbsp;  This course attempts to provide participants with an exposure to the challenges of managing strategically, to the complexity associated with general management responsibilities. With the other courses on the same themes, it aims at the development of the personal capabilities, skills and attitudes to understand and cope effectively with these challenges. In particular, the ability to integrate different dimensions of a problem, to apply both logic and judgement in analysing situations, to develop an overarching vision for your actions, and to assess the consequences of your actions on an organisation as a whole will be key learning elements of the course.
