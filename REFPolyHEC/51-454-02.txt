TitreCours: Organizational Design and Processes
DescriptionCours: "Being a Manager and a Strategist," the course from the program's first stage, allowed us to examine a certain number of issues regarding the orientation and content of the management role, as well as the philosophies and styles which may underlie and characterize its practice. But for a more in-depth discussion of the roles, activities and responsibilities involved in managing, we need to look at organizations as providing the contexts for action.  &nbsp;  The present course is thus intended to familiarize students with businesses as settings in which action and life take place; an understanding of these settings and their particular requirements can foster better adapted management practices.
