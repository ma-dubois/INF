TitreCours: Organizational Behavior
DescriptionCours: Psychology is a science that allows us to better understand people's behaviours .&nbsp; If, however, psychology cannot be seen as a panacea containing all the answers regarding our own and others' behaviours, it does propose some key elements in order for us to orient our individual experiences and help us solve our problems.&nbsp; Furthermore, psychology is a fundamental discipline in business administration, management and individual supervision.  &nbsp;  The Organizational Psychology course aims at providing students with the psychological knowledge necessary to enrich their comprehension of their own as well as others' behaviours not only in their working environments but also in their everyday lives.
