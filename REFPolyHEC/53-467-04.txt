TitreCours: Sectorial Analysis and Business Opportunities
DescriptionCours: Entrepreneurs usually identify a business opportunity in a sector they know or have learned to analyze and decode.&nbsp; Most firms are launched in areas in which their creators have acquired some experience and expertise.&nbsp; Understanding a business sector is one of the fundamental basic requirements of business practice.  &nbsp;  Some of the basic skills required to identify true business opportunities can be derived from an understanding of the strategies of a sector leader, how new elements and innovations are incorporated into a sector, and the hierarchy of firms in a sector.&nbsp; Using these elements, venture creators are able not only to identify business opportunities but also to design ways of differentiating themselves and their firms within a given market.&nbsp; This constitutes the learning from the last stage preceding the preparation of a business plan and venture start-up.&nbsp; It follows on from learning about visionary and entrepreneurial thinking, and precedes learning about small business management (53-457-05).  &nbsp;  This course on sector analysis and business opportunities will provide conceptual guidelines for understanding environmental trends, analyzing a business sector and identifying business opportunities.&nbsp; It is a natural extension of&nbsp;the course&nbsp;"Visionary and Entrepreneurial Thinking" (53-456-03) and an excellent preparation for the course on the Business Plan (53-059-04).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
