TitreCours: Being a Manager and a Strategist
DescriptionCours: Management is not an art, neither is it a science; managers are not technicians nor are they scientists. At the same time, if it is obvious that managers take decisions, it is also true that such decisions are often made in the flow of action. Consequently, understanding management and proposing management tools have become increasingly difficult: most management fads are fast lived, and organizational forms evolve quickly.  &nbsp;  This complexity of management explains the perspective we adopted in this course. We propose here to consider management as a practice, i.e, an activity that is often complex, fast, and that emerges from practice and depends on ever-changing competencies.
