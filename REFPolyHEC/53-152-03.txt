TitreCours: Managing Customer Relationships
DescriptionCours: As information about customers become more plentiful and detailed, and as customers themselves become more interactive with the companies they buy from, executives face a radically different competitive landscape.  It was never easy to differentiate your product or service, and today it is more difficult than ever. Instead, your competitive success hinges increasingly on using customer-level information and interaction to create long-term, profitable 1 to 1 customer relationships. &nbsp; The magnitude of this revolution is startling. Already, the most successful firms in a wide variety of industries and disciplines are precisely those that do embrace these principles of 1 to 1 relationship marketing (or management). Dell computer is now the benchmark of success in the PC business.  Cisco, FedEx, Amazon.com and many others have built their success on customer knowledge and interaction.  Everyday, on every continent, managers and executives are wrestling with the issue of how to deal with this revolution. Before Customer Relationship Management can be adopted by most companies, a number of internal barriers will need to be overcome.  This means that everyone from suppliers, to employees, customers and others, including retailers and other members of the distribution channels, investors and the board of directors, need to be forged into a "chain of relationship" that will add ever increasing value to the end-customer relationship.  That's what this course is all about.  &nbsp;
