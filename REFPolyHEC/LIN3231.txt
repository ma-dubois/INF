DescriptionCours: The aim of this course is to lead students to develop a critical approach to selecting, adapting and creating ESL teaching materials that meet the needs of their learners and the requirements of the MELS. Students will learn how to design a grid for materials assessment that will allow them to evaluate textbooks, workbooks, software and other teaching materials. They will also learn how and when to use teaching materials optimally, how to create materials when none are available, and how to use technological resources in materials development. The development of students' skills and professional abilities will be documented by means of a portfolio.
