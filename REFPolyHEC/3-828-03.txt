TitreCours: International Economics
DescriptionCours: Globalization leads to important changes in the worldwide location of the production of goods and services. These changes have profound effects on producers and workers : from Seattle, Washington, Quebec to Genoa, many groups have shown their opposition to or their fear of these changes. The main objective of this course is to help the budding manager, financial officer or economist understand why and how globalization takes place, and how it affects firms, workers and consumers. The tools of modern trade theory are used to understand these phenomenon.&nbsp; We will examine the different theories that help explain trade, why the increasing openness creates tensions and why and how governments try to protect local producers from international competition. The most important part of the semester will be spent analyzing the microeconomics of trade and openness. Time permitting, we will also tackle some macroeconomic topics, from exchange rate markets to the balance of payments.
