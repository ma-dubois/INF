DescriptionCours: The purpose of the above short overview is to give a basis for the claim that there is a need for interdisciplinary research on decision-making and negotiation. The richness and complexity of decision-making and conflict resolution in social settings requires multiple disciplines, perspectives and modelling orientations.
