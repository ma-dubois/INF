TitreCours: American Political Institutions and Business Practices
DescriptionCours: This course aims to initiate the student to the crucial but often forgotten interrelationship between politics and business in Canada and the United States, the world's most important trading relationship. Contrary to traditional courses on business-government relations, which tend to use a more generic approach to the topic, this course begins by familiarizing the student with political institutions (both actors and processes) in both Canada and the U.S. Then it examines particular policy areas that affect business. For each policy area, it compares actors and rules in place in Canada and the U.S. and looks at how they affect the behaviour and performance of business. The course also analyses cases and situations where businesses try to influence the relevant actors in a particular situation order to get a legislative or regulatory outcome that is favourable to them. In sum, this course is of great interest for students who want to obtain a good understanding of the political and policy environment in which Canadian and American enterprises do business, how it impacts them, and how in return they can affect it. This knowledge is necessary for anyone who is or will be involved in devising and/or implementing corporate strategies in a North American context.  &nbsp;  Learning strategy&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The course will consist of lectures, student presentations and class discussions.  &nbsp;  Quizzes (2) (10%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Individual Essay (15%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The essay consists of a critical analysis of the assigned readings for a given week. For each week's readings, there is a series of questions that are sent out a week in advance. Students may answer one or a combination of these questions. They can also answer a different question of their choosing but which is relevant to the assigned readings. In addition, essays should take into account the material seen in previous classes. Students are also encouraged to go beyond class readings in order to provide a more comprehensive and thorough analysis and comment. The assignment of readings to students is done during the introductory class.  &nbsp;  Team Project (30%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Final examination (35%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Take home. It is a case study that will be handed out during Session #12.  &nbsp;   Participation (10%)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Participation in class and on the web forum is an integral part of the course and, therefore, is taken into account in the overall course evaluation.  &nbsp;
