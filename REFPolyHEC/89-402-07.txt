TitreCours: CO-ADMI 811P Research Methods in Management
DescriptionCours: This course is designed to familiarize students with basic research methods issues and techniques in organizational behavior, strategy, and human resources management. It is also appropriate for some students in MIS and accounting. The course is concerned mostly with quantitative research techniques rather than qualitative techniques, which are covered in depth in other joint program courses. Unlike some research methods courses, this one is concerned with the whole of the research process, beginning with how theory gets converted into research ideas and finishing with the publication cycle. Emphasis will be placed on critiquing published research in light of what we are studying. The course will provide much "inside information" on professional issues in the organizational sciences pertaining to the research and publication process, including the pitfalls that lead to manuscript rejection and the factors that influence editorial decisions.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Pour consulter l'horaire des cours, veuillez cliquer ici &nbsp;
