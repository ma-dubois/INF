TitreCours: CO-ADMI 851E Strategic Management in Transitional Enterprise : Public to Private
DescriptionCours: This seminar examines the elements of strategic management in transitional enterprise. Transitional enterprises are those that have been privatized, and the course includes the study of enterprise in different national and economic environments. The focus of the course is managerial, not public policy. This said, the elements of public policy decisions that form constraints on strategic management are included in the study. The course draws on literature from a wide variety of disciplines, including the literature of strategy, management, international business, economics, political science, public administration and sociology. As such, it provides an opportunity to integrate the foundation disciplines of strategic management in a PhD seminar.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Pour consulter l'horaire des cours, veuillez cliquer ici &nbsp;
