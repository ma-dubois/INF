TitreCours: Introduction to Operations Research
DescriptionCours: This course presents several traditional applications of operations research in finance, economy, marketing, and production management. We focus more particularly on the modeling of problems and on the analysis of the solutions obtained. The stress is laid on applications which can be modelled as linear programs. For each problem considered, the student is brought to formulate a mathematical model representing the situation, to solve this model, and to interpret the results. The solution of these problems required the use of a computer and specialized software. In this course, we make use of the Excel Solver and we see how to interpret the results that it provides.
