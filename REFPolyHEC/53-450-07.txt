TitreCours: High-Technology Entrepreneurship
DescriptionCours: This action-oriented course is targeted to MBA students wishing to influence the success of new high-tech ventures, whether they plan to work in support systems for high-tech entrepreneurs or to become involved in high-tech entrepreneurship themselves.  The global phenomenon of high-tech entrepreneurship is probably one of the most desired niches for today's young entrepreneurs; yet many high-tech inventors and creative individuals fail to launch or sustain a business due to a lack of knowledge of some basic entrepreneurial knowledge of the subject.  &nbsp;  Some researchers are highly enthusiastic about their scientific and technological innovations but very few of them can turn start-up ventures into highly successful enterprises. Potential entrepreneurs need both training and practical (real-world) experience to succeed.  This course is a learning experience that involve students in a demanding process in which they will be encouraged and expected to make their own contributions through analyses of case studies and video clips, as well as through class discussions and participation in business games. The course requires developing some working relationships with colleagues and in this way will provide the students with opportunities to brainstorm on the main entrepreneurial activities and processes high-tech entrepreneurs use-or should use-in the context of their dynamic and competitive environments. The course will reflect upon these by using the unique concepts and frameworks relevant to both entrepreneurship and high-tech environments.  The course uses a number of teaching approaches, including lectures, discussions of course themes, video clips, case studies and interactive exercises.  &nbsp;  Summary of the course outline  &nbsp;   Session 1 : The high-tech entrepreneurial world and its support systems  Session 2 :&nbsp;Opportunity exploitation in high-tech surroundings  Session 3 :&nbsp;Creativity and innovation  Session 4 :&nbsp;Learning, knowledge and teams management in high-tech environments  Session 5 :&nbsp;Building a competitive advantage and marketing niche  Session 6 :&nbsp;The high-tech strategy for sustainability and growth  &nbsp;  See the complete course outline on the web site of Zone cours.
