TitreCours: Management Skills
DescriptionCours: This course will assist students in developing some of the skills required to adequately carry out the activities and accept the responsibilities associated with managing people . The word "skills" used in this context refers to abilities that: 1) are appropriate in a particular situation , 2) are suited to the person who exercises them and 3) are likely to lead to the desired outcome .&nbsp; In order to evaluate the merits and the effectiveness of a particular management skill, we look for four elements: an appropriate analysis, given the situation (this analysis may be explicit or implicit, intuitive or rationalised); a consciously-made decision about the actions to be undertaken; the adequate implementation of this decision;&nbsp; the realisation of the desired objectives.  &nbsp;  In addition, the course has been designed to provide students whose mother tongue is not English with the occasion to practice their English oral and written skills in true-to-life management situations. Case discussion and exercises in the classroom will allow students to interact with each other in English and to hone their skills of oral communication and persuasion. The short case analyses will enable students to perfect their skills in written English. [1]      [1] NOTE&nbsp;: All class discussion will take place in English, with the exception of the contest based on the Monique Landry case. All assignments are to be submitted in English. All of the cases (except Monique Landry ) and exercises used in the course, as well as most of the accompanying readings, have been provided in English.
