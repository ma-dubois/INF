TitreCours: HEC Montreal Challenge
DescriptionCours: In this course, students will work in teams&nbsp;on a "live case" that one of the partner companies will bring to the class. The main objective is to provide the students the opportunity to apply what they have learned in the first two phases of the program to a real and complex business problem. They will have to integrate and synthesize their knowledge in order to propose an acceptable solution.  &nbsp;  The partner companies in 2006 are Mediagrif, Hewitt Equipement, Cossette Communications, CapGemini and&nbsp;123 Certification.com.  &nbsp;  In the first class, representatives of the company will present the "live case" to the students. In the following five weeks, they will document, structure and analyse it, imagine realistic solutions, write a professional report that documents their analysis and finally present it all to a jury composed of faculty members and representatives from the companies. The winning team (hence the title HEC Challenge) will have the opportunity to present their results to the top management of the company.  &nbsp;  There will be regular meetings with faculty to evaluate the progress.&nbsp;Students are expected to complete approximately 60 hours of course work.  &nbsp;  The final grade will be based on the quality of the intermediate progress report, final report and in-class presentation.  &nbsp;  The specific objectives of this course are as follows:    To integrate, synthesize and apply the knowledge acquired in the first two phases of the program;   To develop their decision-making skills in a real, complex, uncertain and unstructured setting;   To use their business acumen and creativity in designing their recommendations;   To further develop their ability to work in teams and to sharpen their presentation and decision-making skills.&nbsp;
