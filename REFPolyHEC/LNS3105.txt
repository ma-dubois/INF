TitreCours: Internship 3
DescriptionCours: This is an internship course during which students will spend 5 weeks in a secondary classroom. The students will begin their internship by familiarizing themselves with the school in which they are placed and with the teaching style and activities of their cooperating teacher. Students will slowly assume a more active role in the classroom and will assume partial responsibility for classes. On-campus meetings will allow students to come together to analyze and reflect on their teaching experiences, on the effectiveness of different techniques and activities, and on observations made in different teaching contexts. The results of the reflective activities will be added to the students' portfolios. Concomitant: LNS3005 Preparation for Internship 3: ESL at the Secondary Level.
