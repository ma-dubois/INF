TitreCours: Managerial Economics
DescriptionCours: This course is intended to enable managers to understand the competitive structure in which companies evolve and the behaviour that the companies adopt vis-a-vis the competition. The ultimate objective is to improve decision making among managers through the use of several basic micro-economic concepts. The theoretical elements covered are illustrated by examples and analyses of magazine and newspaper articles. Themes discussed include profit maximization, other objectives pursued by firms, firm revenues and elasticity of demand, the production functions short and long-term costs, market equilibrium and the functioning of price mechanisms, product differentiation, entry barriers and market power, pricing techniques and various forms of oligopoly.
