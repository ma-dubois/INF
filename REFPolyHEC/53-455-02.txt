TitreCours: Being a CEO
DescriptionCours: INTRODUCTION  This course about the role of president is intended to show the challenges dealt with by executive officers on a daily basis. Running an entire company presupposes not only in-depth knowledge of techniques and the sector, it also depends on the personality and individual qualities of the person presiding over the destiny of the enterprise. Directors are constantly being bombarded with information from both inside and outside the enterprise, information that they must be able to synthesize and translate into a simple plan of action. Because of their activities, they are also in constant negotiation with a variety of actors who interact with the enterprise and on whom its survival depends.  &nbsp;  SPECIFIC COURSE OBJECTIVES  Insofar as the role of executive officers involves all the complexity and unpredictability that an enterprise faces, we cannot approach this course with simple, well-defined models. Instead, the course is intended to stimulate student awareness of the multiple constraints and pressures that executives face as they carry out their role. At the same time, the course is intended to help the student develop a schema for understanding the path decision-making follows in the enterprise as a whole.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
