TitreCours: Basic Corporate Finance
DescriptionCours: The aim, content and intended audience for this course are essentially the same as for its french-language counterpart, 2-200: Finance. The primary difference is simply the language of instruction. This course is well-suited for those who expect to work in a bilingual or english financial environment, those who english is better than their french, or those who wish to practice or improve their english.  &nbsp;  The course will focus on the problems facing a financial manager of a Canadian business.&nbsp; In particular, we will examine how to obtain adequate funds to allow a firm to operate, and how to decide on the optimal allocation of funds obtained by the firm.&nbsp; To obtain funds, the financial manager must participate in markets for debt and equity securities, so we will discuss how these markets work and how they can be most efficiently used by the firm.&nbsp; In allocating funds, we will learn how to assess the economic benefits of long-lived projects and how to make optimal choices between projects.&nbsp; We will also spend time developing basic financial tools that will assist us in the decision-making process.
