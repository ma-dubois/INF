TitreCours: Portfolio presentation
DescriptionCours: The aim of this course is for students to provide a summative overview of their progress in the course of their BA programme so that each individual can identify points to be strengthened and areas of professional interest to be explored in the years to come. The main activity of this course consists in the oral presentation of the electronic portfolio showing how each student has progressed professionally over the four years of the programme. This presentation will be made before a committee consisting of at least two faculty members, instructors or people from the school system. On-campus meetings will take place at the beginning of the session and for the portfolios presentations at the end. Both the oral presentation and the portfolio will be evaluated.
