TitreCours: Strategic Management II
DescriptionCours: This module follows and complements Strategic Management I. Again, our focus is those problems that are of general management relevance, that are critical for the short-term survival and long-term development of the firm. These strategic problems are most often vague, ill-defined, transfunctional or involve various individuals within the firm. They may question the culture of the firm, its role in its society as well as its existence.  &nbsp;  This module gives particular to strategy implementation and strategic action issues. As a first step, we will explore the linkage between the strategy and the organization of the firm and particularly the role of the organization in the implementation of strategy. We will introduce elements of corporate strategy and examine the concept of corporate competitive advantage. To conclude the course, now that fundamental elements of strategy analysis will be mastered, we will examine the challenges associated with the implementation of a strategic action plan in different performance contexts. This section will permit us to look at the role of the manager in the implementation of strategy.
