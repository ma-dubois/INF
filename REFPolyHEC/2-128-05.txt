TitreCours: Consumer Behavior
DescriptionCours: Studying and understanding consumer behavior is prerequisite for the success to firms in the marketplace.  &nbsp;  Consumer behavior studies factors that influence the acquisition, consumption, and disposition of products, services, and ideas. This course focuses on how and why consumers make specific decisions, and behave in certain ways, what motivate them, what capture their attention, and what retain their loyalty? To answer such questions, we examine the individual and group characteristics that influence consumers' decisions and behaviors, such as demographics, lifestyles, personality, values, culture and family.  &nbsp;  The principles from a number of disciplines are used including economics, psychology, social psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Therefore it is the course within the marketing curriculum that most directly applies concepts, principles, and theories from very various social sciences.
