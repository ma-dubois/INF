TitreCours: Advanced grammar for Teachers of English
DescriptionCours: The aim of this course is to introduce students to specific grammatical issues in oral and written contemporary English. This course introduces future ESL teachers to the less common grammatical resources of English, particularly in problematic areas for even advanced francophone learners: tense, mood, and aspect. It similarly introduces teachers to grammatical variation in English: to the grammars of written and spoken English, and to the gray zones between idiom and grammar.
