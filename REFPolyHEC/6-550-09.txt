TitreCours: Decision support tools for the operations manager
DescriptionCours: In this course, the emphasis is on analytically modeling and analysing typical business problems from production and operations management, innovation management and performance measurement. Typical applications include: production planning and lotsizing, efficiency measurement, process flexibility, component commonality, innovation project analysis, production level decisions under uncertainty, R&amp;D portfolio management, project scheduling and revenue management. We make use of modeling concepts that are used behind the screen of many Decision Support Systems, including linear programming, Data Envelopment Analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, trade-off analysis and decision trees. Through examples, class discussions, case studies and workshops the students become familiar with the concepts, the solution approaches, and the practical applications in Operations Management. Throughout most of the the classes, we will make use of some Excel-based decision support tools (Solver, PrecisionTree, @Risk and EMS) to analyze these business problems. The focus is on the various applications.  &nbsp;   The aim of the course is:  &nbsp;    &nbsp;to develop analytical skills to structure and model business decision problems in the area of Operations Management;   to discuss typical applications for these decision support tools in Operations Management;   to develop practical skills in solving these problems by hands-on experience with Excel-based decision support tools.
