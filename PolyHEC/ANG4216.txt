TitreCours: Advanced English Computer
DescriptionCours: This course is designed for students at the advanced level of English who want to work on their text skills (reading and writing) through computer-assisted activities. Class assignments require only a rudimentary level of computer knowledge, but students who lack these skills should be prepared to attend additional workshops. The course follows from three assumptions about the further development of second-language literacy at an advanced level. The first is that vocabulary expansion is likely to be a major part of this development; the second is that extensive practice will play a major role; and the third is that instructional interventions and feedback are more suitably directed to individuals than to groups. Communication technologies will play a large part in implementing these assumptions. First in vocabulary, participants undertake independent lexical research using on and off-line resources, contributing their findings to a shared lexical database. Second, to gain extensive reading and writing practice, groups of similar professional or scholarly interests prepare substantial documents for weekly class discussions which are then continued in writing over an electronic bulletin board. Third, instructors monitor a sample of all database and bulletin board contributions for grammatical and lexical appropriateness and return feedback to individuals.
